# ERC-20 Token Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The token adheres to the ERC-20 standard, which ensures compatibility with a wide range of Ethereum-based applications. The development process is carried out using **Remix IDE**, a browser-based development environment that simplifies smart contract creation and deployment.

## Token Specifications
- **Name**: YourTokenName
- **Symbol**: YTN
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000 tokens
- **Decimals**: 18 (standard for ERC-20)

---

## Why Ethereum?
Ethereum is the leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Its well-established ecosystem and robust developer community make it an ideal choice for token development. Specifically:
1. **Standardization**: ERC-20 is the most widely adopted token standard.
2. **Compatibility**: Ensures integration with wallets, exchanges, and other DApps.
3. **Flexibility**: Ethereum's smart contract functionality supports advanced features.

---

## Programming Language
The token is implemented using **Solidity**, the standard language for Ethereum smart contract development. Solidity provides:
- Comprehensive support for smart contract programming.
- Native compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- Built-in libraries and standards like ERC-20.

---

## Development Tools
The project is developed using:
- **[Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)**: A browser-based IDE for writing, compiling, and deploying Solidity smart contracts. It offers a user-friendly interface, real-time feedback, and integrated testing tools.

---

## Features of the Token
1. **Mintable and Burnable** (Optional):
   - Ability to create or destroy tokens as needed.
2. **Ownership Management**:
   - Restricted functions for the owner, ensuring security.
3. **Compliance**:
   - Fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard for interoperability.

---

## Deployment
The token is deployed on the **Ethereum testnet (Goerli)** to avoid costs associated with the mainnet. The deployment steps are as follows:
1. Write the contract in Solidity and test it on Remix.
2. Compile and deploy the contract to the Goerli testnet.
3. Verify the smart contract on [Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/).

---

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install MetaMask for Ethereum account management.
   - Access the Goerli testnet to obtain test ETH.

2. **Steps**:
   - Open Remix IDE and paste the ERC-20 contract code.
   - Compile the contract.
   - Deploy it to the Goerli testnet using MetaMask.
